# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to use HTML and Javascript to filter for multiple criteria at the same time in order to adjust a website so users can identify information about UFOs in specific locations at speficic times. 

## Results
Upon viewing this website, the user first sees an introductory message and all of the data available about UFOs unfiltered in a table:

When the user navigates to the filtering section, they can filter by date, city, state, country or shape. This can be used to obtain broad information about UFO sightings. For example, if a user wanted to use a filter just to view triangle shaped UFO sightings, they could fill in only the shape filter:

Additionally, this website could be used to find information on a specific UFO sighting incident. This is an image of how a user would input information to identify a specific sighting in Princeton, IN.

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that it can only take inputs from the user that have lower case letters. To improve the website, I might try to alter the data so words that are usually capitalized, such as cities, can be in the search criteria. An additional recommendation for further development is creating checkboxes for years instead of having the website filter for years. Because there is not very much data, it is confusing for a user who is looking for a broader set of data that this website can be useful for. Creating checkboxes for years would give the user a better sense of what information is available.
